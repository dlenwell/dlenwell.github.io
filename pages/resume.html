<p>805.616.2270 - dlenwell@gmail.com</p>
<p>Technology has been a passion throughout my life. That is no different today than it was when I was 9 years old and glued to my computer 16+ hours a day. I thrive on learning new technology. I am at my most comfortable when utterly challenged and under pressure. I endeavor to teach and learn from peers, subordinates and supervisors.  </p>
<p>I have made it my goal to become part of a team that will encourage growth and and a free exchange of ideas. I envision developing open source software that includes imagination, innovative tools and innovative techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Coding skills:</strong>
Python, PHP, Javascript, CSS and all things front-end</p>
<p><strong>Some of the open source I know and love:</strong>
Linux (ubuntu, redhat, slackware), Apache, MySQL, kvm, gearman, memcache, gerrit, pecan, flask, django, Open Stack, git, SQL Alchemy, OpenWRT</p>
